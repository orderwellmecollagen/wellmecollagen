How Does WellMe Collagen Refresh Work?
--------------------------------------

Collagen is the main protein that comprises connective tissue like tendons, ligaments, skin, hair, and muscles. The protein offers structural support, skin elasticity, and muscle, joint, and bone strength.

Collagen production declines with age, causing the skin to lose its elasticity and heightening the appearance of wrinkles, fine lines, sagging, and dullness. It also causes weak and brittle bones, hair loss, and joint pain. The best way to replenish your collagen levels is to improve your body's ability to produce more Collagen.

Extracellular Triple Helical Collagen (refreshed Collagen) is the joint-supporting Collagen that supports joint and skin health. You can get Collagen from animal sources, but it's less effective than Refreshed Collagen.

For smooth and flexible joints, you need internal production of Refreshed Collagen. The WellMe Collagen Refresh formula is designed to enable your body to produce Collagen for healthy joints. The ingredients in the doctor-formulated supplement fortify your cartilage, provide strong balance and coordination, support healthy inflammatory responses, and improve flexibility.

WellMe Collagen Refresh has three types of Collagen essential in skin hydration, supporting the immune system, and enhancing bone and joint health. The formula has minerals and vitamins that help DNA synthesis and keratin production, which is responsible for the growth of hair and nails.

Vitamins C and E in WellMe Collagen Refresh are rich in antioxidants that neutralize the free radicals that cause skin and hair damage. Neutralizing the free radicals slows down aging and replenishes your skin. WellMe Collagen Refresh repairs damaged skin cells caused by oxidative stress and free radicals and give you new and healthy cells.

**Copper**

Copper is a primary mineral that supports organ, tissue, and cell function.

Additionally, copper is responsible for melanin production, which prevents damage by sunlight and helps strengthen the collagen fibers in the connective tissues.

**Vitamin C**

Vitamin C supports hydroxyproline production, a building block for internally Refreshed Collagen. A lack of Vitamin C in the body can cause minimal collagen production. Vitamin C is rich in antioxidants that fight free radicals and environmental toxins that break down Collagen.

Vitamin C prevents premature aging, which is associated with the appearance of wrinkles, fine lines, and saggy skin. The ingredient helps the body create new Collagen and keeps it intact and firm for a long time.

**Vitamin E**

Vitamin E supports the disappearance of scars and stretchmarks from pregnancy and reduces wrinkles. The vitamin helps strengthen the collagen fibers, preventing damage and trauma. Strong collagen fibers provide long-lasting structure and make them resistant to breaking down.

**Polypodium leucotomos (Calaguala Powder)**

The fern extract has various skin-supporting benefits, including collagen production. Polypodium leucotomos helps strengthen the collagen fibers and improve the skin's resilience when exposed to sunlight.

**Type I and Type III Collagen**

WellMe Collagen Refresh has a blend of Type I and III collagen peptides that fortify the body's natural collagen production.

**Hydrolyzed Bovine Collagen**

Hydrolyzed bovine Collagen is a Type I collagen peptide that boosts internal collagen production for healthy bone density and inflammatory response and helps maintain comfortable movement. According to studies, Hydrolyzed bovine Collagen can reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines within 30 days and reduce the appearance of cellulite on the skin. Additionally, the hydrolyzed Collagen supports nail growth and smoothness and lessens nail breakage by up to 42%.

**Eggshell Collagen Peptides**

Eggshell collagen peptides are a Type III collagen essential for reducing skin discoloration and redness. In a 2017 study, eggshell collagen peptides were found to improve skin tone and flawlessness and enhance skin elasticity by up to 12%, thus helping the skin maintain its natural shape.

**Marine Collagen Peptides**

Marine collagen peptides are a source of Type I Collagen. It is low in molecular weight, making it easy to absorb in the body to support joint and skin health. A 2018 study showed that women who used marine collagen peptides had occasional joint pain, the appearance of crow's feet was reduced by 15%, and skin hydration increased by up to 28%. In addition, the women had a smoother and more youthful appearance in 12 weeks.

**Hyaluronic Acid**

Hyaluronic acid is crucial for skin and joint health. WellMe Collagen Refresh works with collagen peptides to cushion and lubricate your body tissues. Hyaluronic acid supports the production of synovial fluid, which is important in preventing joint and cartilage damage.

A 2015 research revealed that hyaluronic acid could reduce joint pain, make you look younger, and enhance the effects of Collagen in the body.
